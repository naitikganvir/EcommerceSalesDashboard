🌟 🚀 Excited to share my recent hands-on experience on Project ☘️ 

Over the past few days, I worked on building powerful dashboards and reports that turned raw data into meaningful insights. Here’s what I explored and implemented :

✨ Designed interactive dashboards to track and analyze online sales performance.
 ✨ Enabled drill-down analysis with filters and slicers for deeper customization.
 ✨ Built relationships, joins, and calculations to manipulate data and create user-driven parameters.
 ✨ Developed customized visualizations including bar charts, pie charts, donut charts, clustered bar charts, scatter plots, line & area charts, maps, and slicers.
This journey has shown me how impactful data visualization can be in driving smarter decisions. 🚀
